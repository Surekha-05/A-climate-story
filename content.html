                Since the beginning of the 20th century, temperatures in Washington have risen almost 2°F (Figure 1), and since 1986, all but 5 years have been above the long-term (1895–2020) average. The hottest year on record was 2015, with a statewide average temperature of 50.0°F, which was 3.7°F above the long-term average. The overall warming trend is evident in an increased number of warm nights.The hottest year on record was 2015, with a statewide average temperature of 50.0°F, which was 3.7°F above the long-term average. The overall warming trend is evident in an increased number of warm nights. Since 1990, the numbers of very cold nights in Eastern Washington and freezing days in Western Washington have both been below average (Figure 2a). However, the numbers of very warm nights in Eastern Washington and warm nights in Western Washington have both been above average since 1990 (Figure 3). The numbers of very hot days in Eastern Washington and hot days in Western Washington have been quite variable but were both generally above average during the 2015–2020 period, after below average numbers during the 2010–2014 period.

            <h2>Variations in April 1 Snow Water Equivalent (SWE)</h2>
            <p class="justified" id="climate-text">
                Variations in April 1 snow water equivalent (SWE) at the Fish Lake, Washington, snow course site from 1943 to 2019. SWE, the amount of water contained within the snowpack, varies widely from year to year, but there is a general downward trend. The extremely low snowpack levels in 2005 (third lowest) were due to below average winter precipitation and above average winter temperatures. In 2015 (record lowest), warmer than normal winter temperatures were the main driver of the drought, causing more precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow. Source: NRCS NWCC.

                Global mean sea level (GMSL) change from 1800 to 2100. Projections include the six U.S. Interagency Sea Level Rise Task Force GMSL scenarios (Low, navy blue; Intermediate-Low, royal blue; Intermediate, cyan; Intermediate-High, green; High, orange; and Extreme, red curves) relative to historical geological, tide gauge, and satellite altimeter GMSL reconstructions from 1800–2015 (black and magenta lines) and the very likely ranges in 2100 under both lower and higher emissions futures (teal and dark red boxes). Global sea level rise projections range from 1 to 8 feet by 2100, with a likely range of 1 to 4 feet. Source: adapted from Sweet et al. 2017.
